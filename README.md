# Real-Time-FIR-Filter-Implementation-on-DE1-SoC
This project involved designing a real-time FIR Low-Pass Filter on a Terasic DE1-SoC FPGA using VHDL. I developed core modules for I2C/I2S codec initialization and serial-to-parallel conversion. Validated via Quartus Prime and Questa simulations, the system was hardware-tested with a 1–30kHz sweep to analyze frequency response and cut-off ranges.
